# Writing VIVO acceptance tests

## TBD

## NOTES

* prepend_before -- set files.
	* What variables are available?

* What global variables are available?

* What before and after hooks already exist?
	* If you add a hook, where does it go in the sequence?

* What does configuration.rb do? 
	* Especially, one step kills the entire test.	
* Deviate from the pattern of converted tests.

* Artifacts of style come from the previous system, and the automated conversion
	* Very long stories in the tests
	* shared_examples to break into files

* What is available when we crash? When we don't crash?
